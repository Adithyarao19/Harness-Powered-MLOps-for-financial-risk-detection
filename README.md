# üõ°Ô∏è Harness-Powered MLOps Pipeline for Financial Risk Detection

This project demonstrates a production-ready **MLOps pipeline** for deploying a financial risk detection model using modern DevOps practices. Built with **Python**, **DVC**, **Docker**, **FastAPI**, and deployed using **Harness CI/CD**, it reflects secure, automated, and scalable ML deployment pipelines inspired by enterprise architectures like those used at **State Street**.

## üéØ Objective

To simulate real-world deployment of a machine learning model that detects anomalies in financial transactions, with a focus on:
- Infrastructure automation
- Secure deployments
- Version control for data and models
- Real-time serving
- Observability and rollback safety
